8/8/17,10:00:00 AM,RCB,REU Workshop Swtich out sonde 1 to2,2,10:35,D1,,"Sonde unexpectedly clean, simply hooked up sonde 2 and deployed, gave a small lesson to REU students "
9/6/17,11:15:00 AM,RCB,Switch out O2 and Turbidity probes and put a cap on and cleaned PVC pipe,2,11:55,D2,,"Sonde was quite dirty but didn't have time to clean, optics were clean, nothing unexpected, need to take pics, pipe was cleaned and cap installed, wiper did not want to work from the dash board but worked when taking a reading, logging was also changed to 15mins, probes were hard to get out as O-ring seemed to have gotten wedged in the threads  "
10/6/17,10:45:00 AM,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,11:15,D3,,"Sonde was quite dirty, drift checked it at 10:27, cleaned everything after, we moved the pipe up what we approximated to be a ft. but seems to be very close to the greenup depth regardless, new sonde was in for the 11:15 reading, readings at 10:45 and 11:00 am indicate it was out of the water due to depth "
11/3/17,11:00:00 AM,RCB,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,11:30,D4,,"Sonde was quite dirty but optics were clean, there was a small flathead catfish in the bottom of the guard, we don't know how long it had been in there, depth may have definitely been affected during the drift check as the sonde in place was reading rather shallow in comparison to the one in now, the location was cleaned by shoving off some of the surround mud and soil into the water, turbidity affects maybe seen through the day as a result, sonde was out of the ater the entire time during the shoveling, the sonde was taken out after the 10:45 drift check, the new sonde didnt go in until around 11:30, the time set for the new deployment was set at -5UTC to adjust for daylight savings time on the following Sunday -Josh present "
12/1/17,10:30:00 AM,RCB,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,10:30,RCB_D5,,"Sonde in place now (2) was not calibrated at the 124NTU as a result of being out of solution, it was calibrate at 0 with DI for a 1 point, sonde in place was rather clean, there was a small war mouth sunfish in the bottom of the guard, don’t know how long it has been there, drift check was done for the 10:42 reading, everything went smooth and quick, it was cold outside, Josh present "
1/26/18,1:30:00 PM,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,N/A,N/A,N/A,,"Something had hit the PVC pipe and bowed the clamps out making it loose and could possibly allow the PVC pipe to slide through, only 2 zip ties kept it from doing so, Sonde in place also had 2 sunfish in the probe guard, it wasn't as dirty as expected though, a standard drift check and a SXS were performed, although both sondes were brought back to marshall along with the PVC to be cleaned and add a tape measure. Logan Josh and Hunter present "
2/9/18,1:30:00 PM,RCB,Install sonde 1 and remount PVC pipe,1,3:00,RCB_D6,1,"PVC pipe was reinstalled with tape measure on it now using the exsisting holes but 2 clamps doubled up this time, it was installed at approximately 39.5"" (1m) with respect to the bar which the sonde guard rests on, a measurement was taken for chlorophyll in the bucket that the grab samples were taken from, the sonde was then put in the PVC pipe and recalibrated for depth using an offset of 1m and zeroing it, the sonde was then hooked back up to the data logger and everything was reinstalled as usual. we waited until 3:00 to make sure the logger was able to connect to the laptop, this sonde was not calibrated for conductivity the day before but was 2 weeks ago before it was planned to go out last time (I assumed the condictivity probe to be resilient enough to have held the calibration with no drift in addition i wanted to conserve calibration solution therefroe i didn't calibrate the probe), all other probes were calibrated as normal, Logan and Hunter were present "
3/27/18,1:00:00 PM,RCB,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,2:00,RCB_D7,1.016,"A sxs drift check was done both with the field sonde in place and one sample taken and then ran for a few minutes together, there were 3 small sunfish in the probe guard and it was single sample drift check with them in there, Logan worked on getting chlorophyll samples along with readings from the magic wand (there were relatively close), he asissted with the drift check of running them for several minutes, then the new sonde was placed in the pipe and calibrated for depth at 1.016m as the tape measure indicated it at 41"", the sonde was then programed and hooked up, a barge passed by at about 2:25 as we were leaving, we could see mud stirred up as it went passed in the sonde placement area, everything seemed to go smooth, Logan present"
4/26/18,1:30:00 PM,RCB,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,2:45,RCB_D8,1.09,"Site was extremely muddy, drift meaurements were difficult due to keeping the sondes held in place in the water but both were performed, there were no fish or anything in the sonde guard, I did forget to wrap the sonde guard with tape as I did at Greenup to keep fish out, overall everything went smooth, no real problems other than dealing with the mud, Logan seemed to get all his stuff together fine, Logan present"
5/23/18,12:30:00 PM,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,1:42,RCB_D9,0.94,"Water was fairly turbid but at normal level, single point drift check was done at 12:57, when sonde was pulled out we noticed a small flathead catfish in the bottom of the sonde guard, the fish fell out for the sxs drift check, in the sxs drift check the calibrated sonde was on the right of the pipe and the field one on the left, after the drift checks Logan cleaned the field sonde while i calibrated the depth on the calibrated sonde by placing it in the pipe and putting the offset at 0.94m, then the copper guard was wrapped in gorilla tape like we had done at greenup to try and keep fish out, the sonde was back in and set to take its first sample at 13:42, the torch and sonde were relatively close on the chlorophyll readings but still likely significantly different, Logan expressed no issues doing his work, Logan present"
6/20/18,10:00:00 AM,RCB,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:30,RCB_D9,1.143,"Water was clear, spent the first hour trying to figure out what is wrong with the data logger, it had not been sending data since 6/14, was on the phone with tec support for 40mins trying all kinds of stuff, nothing seemed to work, logger had a problem waking up, reached the verdict with tec support that it would just have to be sent in to inspect, also discussed with them hooking up all the other sensor in which they are supposed to be looking into the power options for me, Logan and i removed the data logger and solar panel, all this was done before even going down to the sonde, the field sonde was drift checked at 11:42 after just missing the 11:27 reading, when field sonde was removed i noticed a small flathead catfish in the guard yet again, the pipe was cleaned and the calibrated sonde calibrated in the pipe at 1.143m for depth, the copper guard was wrapped again but with an additional strand on the bottom holes, the field sonde was placed in pipe with the usual safety cable and an additional one i added attached to the safety chain for the hand rail, the sampling mode was set to normal since no data logger would be used, Logan seem to get his samples without problems, Logan present"
7/26/18,1:00:00 PM,RCB,Switch out sonde 3 to 2 and reinstall datalogger,2,2:00,RCB_D11,1.27,"Water was fairly normal,  a few passing barges locking through making it turbid, first completed drift check, we removing field sonde there was a small flathead in the guard, the field sonde was the dirtiest I have ever seen, was measured 50"" on the pipe, logan had pretty much finished his tasks by this time, next we remounted the data logger which went smoothly back into place, we didn't have any zip ties to secure the extra flying lead cable but i managed to coil it to the safety cable, the cables were ran to the sonde which was then calibrated at 1.27 meters in the pipe as the tape measure indicated, it was then removed and Logan hooked it all up in prep for deployment after i set up the template, i rushed up to get on the hotspot before 2:00 to see it the datalogger was comunicating which it was but the readings were way off, upon arriving back at the office the reading by 15:00 were fine though, must just not had enough time, we picked up everything and left by 2:15, Logan present"
8/3/18,2:00:00 PM,RCB,REU Site visit,2,N/A,RCB_D11,N/A,"Simple site visit to show the REU studnets the site, Logan drove up in the van with all of us, 6 students, myself, Logan, and John May, talked alittle about the site and the Ohio River, also cleaned the pipe, Logan got some grab samples"
8/22/18,1:30:00 PM,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1 and install PAR sensor,1,2:15,RCB_D12,1.275,"Site conditions were normal, first time I took Cody with me, we didn't really know what grab samples Logan normally got but Cody took 3x500ml grab samples and a few readings with the torch, the sonde drift check was performed as normal at 1:45 and the pipe and everything else with the sonde was carried out as normal, when hooking up the new sonde i did notice the red light on the sonde was blinking rather rapidly (once every second or so) i found it odd because i thought it only blinked once every 10secs or so like the DCP adaptor, i may have not paid that much attention before, running the sonde autonomously without a data logger it often blinks just once every ten seconds and only rapidly when taking a reading, i checked it before we left and it was still blinking rapidly but everything seems to be working fine as of 8/23/18, after completing the sonde tasks Cody and i installed the Li-cor PAR sensor, we had stopped at HomeDepot on the way to get supplies, It was mounted to the hand rail right next to the data logger, we ran the wires through the vent fitting on the left side bottom facing the logger, everything seemed to go rather smooth but was time consuming, no major notes worth making, all probes were calibrated the day before except conductivity, Cody S present"
8/24/17,9:00:00 AM,Greenup,"Install of Equipment: Not completed, dropped pipe",N/A,N/A,N/A,,"Went to move housing PVC from the side of the bull nose to behind the platform and dropped it, left the datalogger there already mounted -Logan present "
8/25/17,11:00:00 AM,Greenup,Finish install of Equipment ,1,12:30,GD_D1,,Finished install -Caleb present 
9/22/17,11:30:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,11:50,GD_D2,,"Sonde in place was very muddy but optics were clean, a calibration check was taken with the new sonde for the 11:42 reading, sonde 3 was place along the wall on the close side of the PVC pipe at approximately the same depth (but not sure exactly), the probes were in the same order but new sonde and plug in port 1 and sonde in place had it in port 6 (they were all simply rotated one port over), Josh cleaned the pipe with brush, new sonde 3 connected for the 11:57 reading although not likely in pipe yet "
10/20/17,12:00:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,12:30,GD_D3,,"Sonde wasn't too dirty, drift checked at 11:57, missed the 11:42 one, sonde was switched out by 12:27 but may not have been in the water in time, accurate readings should be considered no earlier than 1:00, Josh and Hunter present "
11/17/17,10:30:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,10:45,GD_D4,,"Sonde was rather clean, there was a small war mouth sunfish in the bottom of the guard, don’t know how long it has been there, drift check was done for the 10:27 reading, sonde 2 was still set to -4UTC during drift check, everything went smooth and quick, it was cold outside, Josh present "
12/14/17,1:30:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,2:30,GD_D5,,"Sonde in place now (3) was not calibrated for conductivity and the turbidity probe was taken from sonde 1 and put on sonde 3, we are out of reagents for turbidity and conductivity probes, during the drift check there was almost no difference in the conductivity therefore i left that one on sonde 3 but turbidity was different therefore i took the probe off 1 and put it on 3 since it was calibrated most recent, the water was clear and cool, this was the first time we tried the new drift check method i proposed, sonde 1 was rather clean which may indicate they can stay in longer during the winter although waiting to run drift check stats, josh present"
3/15/18,1:00:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,1:45,GD_D6,,"First time back out to Greenup in a few months, sonde stopped working on 1/19/2018 at 9:00 on the data logger and 1/18/2018 on the sondes own internal memory, the data logger kept repeating the same last reading since 1/19, logan worked on getting grab samples for chlorophyll analysis, i did the sxs drift checks though the sonde in place didn't take a reading and then when trying to run them together the field sonde wouldn't work and seemed froze up (the wiper wouldn't wipe and the lenses were completely biofouled), i subjectively think any reading past 1/18 should not be considered true, the dcp adapter was blinking red when i first looked at it and then when leaving but it may have been in the middle of a sampling event, we were walking back at 2:18, Logan present "
4/12/18,11:30:00 AM,Greenup,Swtich out sonde 2 to 1,1,12:00,GD_D7,,"All drift check measurements were taken both the single sample and the sxs, Logan got all of his grab samples, everything went by the textbook with no real hicups, i did wrap gorilla tap around the sonde guard in thin strings of 2 around each set of hole (4 strings total) in order to try and keep fish out of the sone guard, the new sonde was in place by noon, Logan present "
5/15/18,11:30:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:00,GD_D8,,"A lot of algae growth on the lock wall where pipe is mounted, also there were turbid plumes in the water that caused inconsistencies when viewed from the wall, they were obvious and not suddle in the least, the field sonde was also extremely muddy but there were no obstructions in site such as fish therefore the tape around the guard must have helped some, the tape was left on for sonde 3, I thought i had some problems saving the drift data as i orignally had it set on single sample instead of cache but changing it to cache retrieve the previous data so i didn't have to wait until the next quarter for the single sample, Logan got his work done sufficiently quick, there was nearly 100% difference between the torch and sonde readings for chlorophyll and phycocianin, also there seemed to be a significant difference between the place where the sonde is mounted and along the wall where i originally mounted it, could be an eddie effect, no real problems occured, the sonde in place now was not calibrated for conductivity, Logan present "
6/14/18,11:15:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,12:00,GD_D9,~1.4,"Water was fairly turbid , normal level, lots of carp along the wall and one near the sonde, decsion was made to stop doing the sxs drift check as it yielded similar results as the single sample and didn't truly represent the drift caused by biofouling inside the pipe since the field sonde had to be removed in order to run, planned to take the data logger with us to study on how to connect suna and cycle up but forgot tools to take off solar panel and lock gates were open making the walk too long to carry plus we were already loaded down, measured that the GJ writing close to the wall is approximately 2m from the bottom of the sonde so i measured 60cm to the water and approximated it at 1.4m deep, forgot to calibrate the sonde at that depth, the single sample drift check was taken at 11:27, the sonde was in the water way before that so therre was more than enough time to aclimate since we just missed the 11:12 reading, the sonde and torch were nearly 100% different readings the sonde near 2 and the torch about 4ug/L, over all it was rough day forgetting everything, it was hot out and a very long walk, logan got his stuff done quick, sonde in place now was also not calibrated for conductivity since May 28th -Logan present "
7/12/18,11:30:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,12:15,GD_D10,~1,"Water was turbid on the side of the wall holding the sonde, it was a noticable plume of turbid water, upon single point drift check the calibrated sonde seemed to have problems with the algae probe, it kept reading significantly negative, it was fully calibrated the day before, after pulling the probe out and putting it back in it seemed to work fine, before the LED's of the probe weren't even flashing but unplug and then plugging it back in seemed to make it work fine, the sinlge point drift check was done at 11:42, the PVC holding pipe was moved upward to be at approximately a meter using the sensor, the sensor was recalibrated with a .21 offset and then stuck in the pipe to make sure we were at about a meter, we used the tape on the field cable to approximate first, then a third clamp was added between the two holding the pipe to the wall, the copper guard was cleaned and put on the calibrated sonde while i setup the deployment, the algal torch readings and the sonde were way of (~4 compared to 10 respectively), it was hard getting the cap on since i moved the pipe but i got it on, the data logger looked fine, we also measured the wall which seemed to be 25 degrees off the vertical which is too much for the hydrocycle, Logan present"
8/9/18,11:30:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:00,GD_D11,,"Site was around normal conditions, drift check was performed at 11:42, the oxygen was off for the first time, it evenutally settled into the same range the field sonde was in within a few hours after being install, must have been an air bubble maybe or something throwing off the reading, all the normal procedures were performed, cleaning the tube etc., nothing was very note worth except this time Daniel went instead of Logan since Logan was with the REU's, there was no algal torch reading since we didn't have it, Daniel got a few grab samples, the calibrated sond was in place by the 12:12 reading, everything went smooth but the oxygen probe being off is rather intreging and doesn't seem quite right, Daniel present "
9/5/18,12:30:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2 and install PAR sensor,2,1:00,GD_D12,,"Normal site conditions, the calibrated sonde was not calibrated for turbidity, conductivity, or pH as a result of lack of solutions, the calibrated sonde was checked and read -0.01NTU in DI and 6.97 pH in pH7 for refference, conductivity was not noted, Cody first began on installing the PAR sensor since he did the one at the RCB with me, he used the mount I made for the top of the datalogger pipe, we first discussed problems with shad by a near by pole but figure we will be able to see the trend in the data so thats definitely something to look for, Logan and I went down to the platform to do our normal tasks, there was alot of fish fry surrounding the platform, i performed the drift check at 11:42, Logan mentioned he was making the decision to not do some sort of measurement with the torch anymore (i can't remember if it was a bucket read or what), Logan pulled the field sonde and cleaned the pipe while i set up the deployment on the calibrated one, Cody was finishing up the PAR sensor about this time, we got everything switched out as normal and everything seemed to conclude very smoothly, upon returning to the office i added the Licor sensor to iChart but it wasn't added to WQ datalive until the next day as i forgot i had to add it there, Cody and Logan were present"
10/3/18,12:15:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,1:00,GD_D13,,"Water was turbid, drift check done at 12:27, put the pH probe from the field deployed sonde onto the calibrated sonde as the pH probe appeared to be spent the day before during calibration, the pH probe on the field deployed sonde didn't show any obvious signs to drift from viewing the data and was cleaned, everything else went as usual, cody did all the grab sampling stuff, there was normal amount of debris on the field sonde and optics were clean, the new deployment was set up for 12:57 and was in place around that time, nothing out of the oridinary to note other that the pH probe, Cody present "
10/31/18,12:00:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:45,GD_D14,,"Water was flowing fairly hard from wind current on the surface, just missed the 12:12 drift check as the computer was having problems, drift check was at 12:27, field sonde had a small crawfish in the sonde guard upon removal, calibrated sonde was set up while Cody cleaned the pipe, copper sonde guard had a bit of rust on the bottom from the stop bolt i presume in the pipe which was cleaned off, calibrated sonde was deployed for 12:42 i believe or 57. not sure, when trying to get the data off the field sonde it threw an error code and was no longer showing a deployment, something must have tripped it when removing it from the pipe, all reading were accounted for until that point and the GD_D13 deployment file was there, still investigating today 11/1 into whats wrong with the sonde as it still isn't wanting to show any readings, All probes on the calibrated sonde were calibrated though turbidity and conductivity were the week before with the USC sonde, Cody also cleaned off the PAR sensor a bit, no other real not worthy events, Cody present "
11/29/18,11:30:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,12:00,GD_D15,,"All probes except conductivity were calibrated the pH and Turbidity were done the previous week with the USC Fourpole sonde on 11/20, then the o2 and chlorophyll were done on 11/27, the conductivity only had one deployment on its last calibration and was in spec so no need to calibrate, it was cold out at the site, water wasn't too turbid but was flowing pretty hard and the workers had suggested they were busy with barge traffic today, made it out to drift check at 11:57, had some connection problems from the calibrated sonde that seemed to be coming from the adaptor where the usb cord plugs in, got it ressolved and it worked fine, field sonde wasn't too dirty at all, no real debris in the guard although there was some sediment, everything was cleaned and the calibrated sonde deployed, cody left a bucket there, nothing of his seemed problematic, no other site note worthy moments, upon data entry i changed the time at 11/4 @ 2am for the end of daylight saving, i left the raw transferred data alone, drift check comparison and all was done 11/29, cody present for field work"

8/8/19,10:45:00 AM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 5 to 1,1,11:27,GD_D21,,"All probes calibrated a few days before on 8/5 except O2 depth and wiper which were done on 8/7, arriving at the site the water was extremely calm and clear, construction going on as it had been near the office, waited on a barge to lock through headed upstream so we could cross, got to the platform and missed the 10:45 sample, dirft check was done at 10:57, then removed the field sonde which was very dirty and biofouled up, the optics looked clean but the body of the sonde was slimmy and muddy, ALSO THERE WAS A CRAWFISH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SONDE GUARD which cody took with him to put in the tank in the lab, i cleaned off the field sonde and even took te brush to it while in the water, unhooked it and prepped the calibrated sonde for deployment, set the first sample for 11:27 as it was just about to pass the 11:12 sample at this time, proceeded to hook up the calibrated sonde for deployment, decided not to use the new copper sonde guard as i didn't have any tape or anything to make the openings smaller as i had done on the field sonde guard so i reused it as usual, put the sonde in the pipe and finished everything up, Cody and i then got some measurements for the SUNA mount, he worked on getting his grab samples and refreshing the game camera for barges, he did mention the torch reading for chlorophyll which was nearly 2x the amount the sonde was reporting, he didn't describe any problems, rinsed off the solar panel with DI and check the data logger which all seemed fine upon leaving, there was a barge pulling into the locks as we were leaving which we waited on, Cody present "
9/5/19,12:45:00 PM,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 5,5,1:15,GD_D22,,"All probes calibrated 9/3 except conductivity which was done 8/22 with USC but has had no deployments, arrived around 12:00 but had to wait quite awhile to get the gate to the bullnose unlocked, finally got to the platform around 12:45 but missed that DC so it was done at 12:57, then i removed the field sonde which was rather dirty and covered in a grit like material kind of like fine asphalt rocks, it also had 1 small crawfish in it, i cleaned it up the best i could and slit my finger on the eyelet of the safety cable as it has rusted anyway for the most part and left a sharp half, I unhooked it all and proceeded to clean the pipe which was extremely dirty and pretty biofouled up with green algae, when cleaning the inside the brush managed to go all the way through after hitting the stop a few times so i figure it had broke or fell out, I decided to go back to the truck and get my tool box to remove the pipe, I did so by simply loosening up the tapcons enough that i could slide the pipe up to where i could work on the bottom, The bolt passing through and worn away to nearly half its original size and come out of one side, I used the safety dog bone of one of the field cables in the sonde box to make a stop at the end of the pipe by putting it through one of the big holes above the orginal location in the pipe and ziptied it in using 6 zipties, it seemed sufficient enough to do until 2 weeks from now, i slide the pipe back down to its original location however i didn't think about the fact that the new stop is about 2"" higher than the orginal bolt that went through, tightened down all the clamps which need replaced or a big washer over the tapcon as the have all bent from where the bolt goes in, put in the calibrated sonde and started the deployment around 13:57 i believe but am now unsure, Cody didn't mention any problems on his behalf, washed off the solar panel and checked the data logger before leaving, Cody present, the drift check poses some interesting questions as to why the oxygen has been off lately and i can't think of a reason, however the chlorophyll reading being so high on the calibrated sonde is questionable as the torch was only reading 3 or so micrograms/L which aligned better with the field sonde, calibrated sonde could have scraped the wall can got more chlorophyll on it as a result or something"
9/19/19,8:00:00 AM,Greenup,Mount SUNA and switch sonde 5 to 2 due to Phycocianin negatives,2,1:00,GD_D23,,"All probes calibrated 9/17 except conductivity which was done 8/22 with USC but has had no deployments, Suna referrence spectrum was also updated 9/17 with less than %5 difference, arrived at the site at 8:30 and waited on gate to close and talked with some USACE higher ups that were visiting the site, got out to the bullnose platform and began mounting suna by starting with the dam side mount, due to water level we could only use the top 2 holes for wedge anchors but drilled 2x 1/4"" holes between them to add 2 tapcons between them, messed up the first 2 wedge anchors by them spinning so had to move over just a bit toward the dam, got the anchors in and tapcons then preceded to mark the lock side mount by installing the whole thing, we realized we really didn't get the dam side mount vertical but envisioned it would be fine, started the other lock side mounting holes by first tapconing it and then predrilling the wedge anchor holes, got this mount all installed but the bottom wedge anchor was at a slight angle as the water level began to rise, it also started spinning after installed but was tight, we then lowered the assembly and installed the pivot bolts with grease, we swung it up and installed the chain to the cage and tapconed in the center link to the platform between the mounts, upon swinging it down into place the holding pins didn't line up so Logan drilled and filed the lock side one while in began wiring up everything for the data logger, we completed everything and checked its operation with the data logger showed new data at 12:30 when i used my hotspot to interogate it, after the Suna install i preceded to drift check and change out the sonde due to the negative BGA readings we had been getting, drift checked at 12:57, it was very dirty with mud and growth upon removal, i cleaned it up and asked Logan to clean the pipe while i set the deployment on the new sonde, time was updated on it and the deployment was all set up for 1:12 if i'm not mistaken, sonde was deployed and we began wrapping everything up, I couldn't changed out the pin in the sonde pipe because the hammer drill was dead SO REMEMBER TO DO THAT NEXT VISIT, i also drilled a hole up higher on the dam side mount of the SUNA to install the retaining pin since we got it so off axis that the pin wouldn't reach all the way through, tools were packed up and the cable ziptied up to the data logger for the SUNA, got to the truck shortly after 2:30, Logan present "
