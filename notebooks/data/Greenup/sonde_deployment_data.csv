8/8/17,10:00:00,RCB,REU Workshop Swtich out sonde 1 to2,2,10:35,D1,,"Sonde unexpectedly clean, simply hooked up sonde 2 and deployed, gave a small lesson to REU students ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9/6/17,11:15:00,RCB,Switch out O2 and Turbidity probes and put a cap on and cleaned PVC pipe,2,11:55,D2,,"Sonde was quite dirty but didn't have time to clean, optics were clean, nothing unexpected, need to take pics, pipe was cleaned and cap installed, wiper did not want to work from the dash board but worked when taking a reading, logging was also changed to 15mins, probes were hard to get out as O-ring seemed to have gotten wedged in the threads  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/6/17,10:45:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,11:15,D3,,"Sonde was quite dirty, drift checked it at 10:27, cleaned everything after, we moved the pipe up what we approximated to be a ft. but seems to be very close to the greenup depth regardless, new sonde was in for the 11:15 reading, readings at 10:45 and 11:00 am indicate it was out of the water due to depth ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11/3/17,11:00:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,11:30,D4,,"Sonde was quite dirty but optics were clean, there was a small flathead catfish in the bottom of the guard, we don't know how long it had been in there, depth may have definitely been affected during the drift check as the sonde in place was reading rather shallow in comparison to the one in now, the location was cleaned by shoving off some of the surround mud and soil into the water, turbidity affects maybe seen through the day as a result, sonde was out of the ater the entire time during the shoveling, the sonde was taken out after the 10:45 drift check, the new sonde didnt go in until around 11:30, the time set for the new deployment was set at -5UTC to adjust for daylight savings time on the following Sunday -Josh present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12/1/17,10:30:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,10:30,RCB_D5,,"Sonde in place now (2) was not calibrated at the 124NTU as a result of being out of solution, it was calibrate at 0 with DI for a 1 point, sonde in place was rather clean, there was a small war mouth sunfish in the bottom of the guard, don’t know how long it has been there, drift check was done for the 10:42 reading, everything went smooth and quick, it was cold outside, Josh present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/26/18,13:30:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,N/A,N/A,N/A,,"Something had hit the PVC pipe and bowed the clamps out making it loose and could possibly allow the PVC pipe to slide through, only 2 zip ties kept it from doing so, Sonde in place also had 2 sunfish in the probe guard, it wasn't as dirty as expected though, a standard drift check and a SXS were performed, although both sondes were brought back to marshall along with the PVC to be cleaned and add a tape measure. Logan Josh and Hunter present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/9/18,13:30:00,RCB,Install sonde 1 and remount PVC pipe,1,3:00,RCB_D6,1,"PVC pipe was reinstalled with tape measure on it now using the exsisting holes but 2 clamps doubled up this time, it was installed at approximately 39.5"" (1m) with respect to the bar which the sonde guard rests on, a measurement was taken for chlorophyll in the bucket that the grab samples were taken from, the sonde was then put in the PVC pipe and recalibrated for depth using an offset of 1m and zeroing it, the sonde was then hooked back up to the data logger and everything was reinstalled as usual. we waited until 3:00 to make sure the logger was able to connect to the laptop, this sonde was not calibrated for conductivity the day before but was 2 weeks ago before it was planned to go out last time (I assumed the condictivity probe to be resilient enough to have held the calibration with no drift in addition i wanted to conserve calibration solution therefroe i didn't calibrate the probe), all other probes were calibrated as normal, Logan and Hunter were present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/27/18,13:00:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,2:00,RCB_D7,1.016,"A sxs drift check was done both with the field sonde in place and one sample taken and then ran for a few minutes together, there were 3 small sunfish in the probe guard and it was single sample drift check with them in there, Logan worked on getting chlorophyll samples along with readings from the magic wand (there were relatively close), he asissted with the drift check of running them for several minutes, then the new sonde was placed in the pipe and calibrated for depth at 1.016m as the tape measure indicated it at 41"", the sonde was then programed and hooked up, a barge passed by at about 2:25 as we were leaving, we could see mud stirred up as it went passed in the sonde placement area, everything seemed to go smooth, Logan present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4/26/18,13:30:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,2:45,RCB_D8,1.09,"Site was extremely muddy, drift meaurements were difficult due to keeping the sondes held in place in the water but both were performed, there were no fish or anything in the sonde guard, I did forget to wrap the sonde guard with tape as I did at Greenup to keep fish out, overall everything went smooth, no real problems other than dealing with the mud, Logan seemed to get all his stuff together fine, Logan present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5/23/18,12:30:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,1:42,RCB_D9,0.94,"Water was fairly turbid but at normal level, single point drift check was done at 12:57, when sonde was pulled out we noticed a small flathead catfish in the bottom of the sonde guard, the fish fell out for the sxs drift check, in the sxs drift check the calibrated sonde was on the right of the pipe and the field one on the left, after the drift checks Logan cleaned the field sonde while i calibrated the depth on the calibrated sonde by placing it in the pipe and putting the offset at 0.94m, then the copper guard was wrapped in gorilla tape like we had done at greenup to try and keep fish out, the sonde was back in and set to take its first sample at 13:42, the torch and sonde were relatively close on the chlorophyll readings but still likely significantly different, Logan expressed no issues doing his work, Logan present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6/20/18,10:00:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:30,RCB_D9,1.143,"Water was clear, spent the first hour trying to figure out what is wrong with the data logger, it had not been sending data since 6/14, was on the phone with tec support for 40mins trying all kinds of stuff, nothing seemed to work, logger had a problem waking up, reached the verdict with tec support that it would just have to be sent in to inspect, also discussed with them hooking up all the other sensor in which they are supposed to be looking into the power options for me, Logan and i removed the data logger and solar panel, all this was done before even going down to the sonde, the field sonde was drift checked at 11:42 after just missing the 11:27 reading, when field sonde was removed i noticed a small flathead catfish in the guard yet again, the pipe was cleaned and the calibrated sonde calibrated in the pipe at 1.143m for depth, the copper guard was wrapped again but with an additional strand on the bottom holes, the field sonde was placed in pipe with the usual safety cable and an additional one i added attached to the safety chain for the hand rail, the sampling mode was set to normal since no data logger would be used, Logan seem to get his samples without problems, Logan present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/26/18,13:00:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 3 to 2 and reinstall datalogger,2,2:00,RCB_D11,1.27,"Water was fairly normal,  a few passing barges locking through making it turbid, first completed drift check, we removing field sonde there was a small flathead in the guard, the field sonde was the dirtiest I have ever seen, was measured 50"" on the pipe, logan had pretty much finished his tasks by this time, next we remounted the data logger which went smoothly back into place, we didn't have any zip ties to secure the extra flying lead cable but i managed to coil it to the safety cable, the cables were ran to the sonde which was then calibrated at 1.27 meters in the pipe as the tape measure indicated, it was then removed and Logan hooked it all up in prep for deployment after i set up the template, i rushed up to get on the hotspot before 2:00 to see it the datalogger was comunicating which it was but the readings were way off, upon arriving back at the office the reading by 15:00 were fine though, must just not had enough time, we picked up everything and left by 2:15, Logan present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8/3/18,14:00:00,RCB,REU Site visit,2,N/A,RCB_D11,N/A,"Simple site visit to show the REU studnets the site, Logan drove up in the van with all of us, 6 students, myself, Logan, and John May, talked alittle about the site and the Ohio River, also cleaned the pipe, Logan got some grab samples",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8/22/18,13:30:00,RCB,Switch out sonde 2 to 1 and install PAR sensor,1,2:15,RCB_D12,1.275,"Site conditions were normal, first time I took Cody with me, we didn't really know what grab samples Logan normally got but Cody took 3x500ml grab samples and a few readings with the torch, the sonde drift check was performed as normal at 1:45 and the pipe and everything else with the sonde was carried out as normal, when hooking up the new sonde i did notice the red light on the sonde was blinking rather rapidly (once every second or so) i found it odd because i thought it only blinked once every 10secs or so like the DCP adaptor, i may have not paid that much attention before, running the sonde autonomously without a data logger it often blinks just once every ten seconds and only rapidly when taking a reading, i checked it before we left and it was still blinking rapidly but everything seems to be working fine as of 8/23/18, after completing the sonde tasks Cody and i installed the Li-cor PAR sensor, we had stopped at HomeDepot on the way to get supplies, It was mounted to the hand rail right next to the data logger, we ran the wires through the vent fitting on the left side bottom facing the logger, everything seemed to go rather smooth but was time consuming, no major notes worth making, all probes were calibrated the day before except conductivity, Cody S present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8/24/17,9:00:00,Greenup,"Install of Equipment: Not completed, dropped pipe",N/A,N/A,N/A,,"Went to move housing PVC from the side of the bull nose to behind the platform and dropped it, left the datalogger there already mounted -Logan present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9/22/17,11:30:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,11:50,GD_D2,,"Sonde in place was very muddy but optics were clean, a calibration check was taken with the new sonde for the 11:42 reading, sonde 3 was place along the wall on the close side of the PVC pipe at approximately the same depth (but not sure exactly), the probes were in the same order but new sonde and plug in port 1 and sonde in place had it in port 6 (they were all simply rotated one port over), Josh cleaned the pipe with brush, new sonde 3 connected for the 11:57 reading although not likely in pipe yet ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/20/17,12:00:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,12:30,GD_D3,,"Sonde wasn't too dirty, drift checked at 11:57, missed the 11:42 one, sonde was switched out by 12:27 but may not have been in the water in time, accurate readings should be considered no earlier than 1:00, Josh and Hunter present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12/14/17,13:30:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,2:30,GD_D5,,"Sonde in place now (3) was not calibrated for conductivity and the turbidity probe was taken from sonde 1 and put on sonde 3, we are out of reagents for turbidity and conductivity probes, during the drift check there was almost no difference in the conductivity therefore i left that one on sonde 3 but turbidity was different therefore i took the probe off 1 and put it on 3 since it was calibrated most recent, the water was clear and cool, this was the first time we tried the new drift check method i proposed, sonde 1 was rather clean which may indicate they can stay in longer during the winter although waiting to run drift check stats, josh present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/15/18,13:00:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,1:45,GD_D6,,"First time back out to Greenup in a few months, sonde stopped working on 1/19/2018 at 9:00 on the data logger and 1/18/2018 on the sondes own internal memory, the data logger kept repeating the same last reading since 1/19, logan worked on getting grab samples for chlorophyll analysis, i did the sxs drift checks though the sonde in place didn't take a reading and then when trying to run them together the field sonde wouldn't work and seemed froze up (the wiper wouldn't wipe and the lenses were completely biofouled), i subjectively think any reading past 1/18 should not be considered true, the dcp adapter was blinking red when i first looked at it and then when leaving but it may have been in the middle of a sampling event, we were walking back at 2:18, Logan present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4/12/18,11:30:00,Greenup,Swtich out sonde 2 to 1,1,12:00,GD_D7,,"All drift check measurements were taken both the single sample and the sxs, Logan got all of his grab samples, everything went by the textbook with no real hicups, i did wrap gorilla tap around the sonde guard in thin strings of 2 around each set of hole (4 strings total) in order to try and keep fish out of the sone guard, the new sonde was in place by noon, Logan present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5/15/18,11:30:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:00,GD_D8,,"A lot of algae growth on the lock wall where pipe is mounted, also there were turbid plumes in the water that caused inconsistencies when viewed from the wall, they were obvious and not suddle in the least, the field sonde was also extremely muddy but there were no obstructions in site such as fish therefore the tape around the guard must have helped some, the tape was left on for sonde 3, I thought i had some problems saving the drift data as i orignally had it set on single sample instead of cache but changing it to cache retrieve the previous data so i didn't have to wait until the next quarter for the single sample, Logan got his work done sufficiently quick, there was nearly 100% difference between the torch and sonde readings for chlorophyll and phycocianin, also there seemed to be a significant difference between the place where the sonde is mounted and along the wall where i originally mounted it, could be an eddie effect, no real problems occured, the sonde in place now was not calibrated for conductivity, Logan present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6/14/18,11:15:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 3 to 2,2,12:00,GD_D9,~1.4,"Water was fairly turbid , normal level, lots of carp along the wall and one near the sonde, decsion was made to stop doing the sxs drift check as it yielded similar results as the single sample and didn't truly represent the drift caused by biofouling inside the pipe since the field sonde had to be removed in order to run, planned to take the data logger with us to study on how to connect suna and cycle up but forgot tools to take off solar panel and lock gates were open making the walk too long to carry plus we were already loaded down, measured that the GJ writing close to the wall is approximately 2m from the bottom of the sonde so i measured 60cm to the water and approximated it at 1.4m deep, forgot to calibrate the sonde at that depth, the single sample drift check was taken at 11:27, the sonde was in the water way before that so therre was more than enough time to aclimate since we just missed the 11:12 reading, the sonde and torch were nearly 100% different readings the sonde near 2 and the torch about 4ug/L, over all it was rough day forgetting everything, it was hot out and a very long walk, logan got his stuff done quick, sonde in place now was also not calibrated for conductivity since May 28th -Logan present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/12/18,11:30:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 2 to 1,1,12:15,GD_D10,~1,"Water was turbid on the side of the wall holding the sonde, it was a noticable plume of turbid water, upon single point drift check the calibrated sonde seemed to have problems with the algae probe, it kept reading significantly negative, it was fully calibrated the day before, after pulling the probe out and putting it back in it seemed to work fine, before the LED's of the probe weren't even flashing but unplug and then plugging it back in seemed to make it work fine, the sinlge point drift check was done at 11:42, the PVC holding pipe was moved upward to be at approximately a meter using the sensor, the sensor was recalibrated with a .21 offset and then stuck in the pipe to make sure we were at about a meter, we used the tape on the field cable to approximate first, then a third clamp was added between the two holding the pipe to the wall, the copper guard was cleaned and put on the calibrated sonde while i setup the deployment, the algal torch readings and the sonde were way of (~4 compared to 10 respectively), it was hard getting the cap on since i moved the pipe but i got it on, the data logger looked fine, we also measured the wall which seemed to be 25 degrees off the vertical which is too much for the hydrocycle, Logan present",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8/9/18,11:30:00,Greenup,Switch out sonde 1 to 3 ,3,12:00,GD_D11,,"Site was around normal conditions, drift check was performed at 11:42, the oxygen was off for the first time, it evenutally settled into the same range the field sonde was in within a few hours after being install, must have been an air bubble maybe or something throwing off the reading, all the normal procedures were performed, cleaning the tube etc., nothing was very note worth except this time Daniel went instead of Logan since Logan was with the REU's, there was no algal torch reading since we didn't have it, Daniel got a few grab samples, the calibrated sond was in place by the 12:12 reading, everything went smooth but the oxygen probe being off is rather intreging and doesn't seem quite right, Daniel present ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
